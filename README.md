# Homebrew Kali 
A Homebrew tap for Kali Linux tools.

# Goals
The ultimate goal is to brew all major Kali Linux tools (not already present in homebrew/homebrew).

# Usage
```
brew tap drppublic/kali
brew install <package>
# That simple.

# Alternatively, without kali on tap:
brew install drppublic/kali/<package>
```
